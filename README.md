## üî¨ Overview

This project introduces QIEE-MARL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates quantum-inspired optimization techniques into the exploration‚Äìexploitation dynamics of multi-agent systems. The primary application explored in this research involves a swarm of nanorobots collaboratively navigating within simulated vascular environments to identify and treat disease cells.

### Key Contributions:

- Integration of Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
- Simulation of a vascular mesh environment mimicking nanorobotic navigation
- Custom reward shaping, state encoding, and agent communication protocols
- Implementation of a quantum-variational heuristic for exploration-exploitation control
- Visualization of agent dynamics and treatment coverage
